    <a href="https://www.supervillain.group/"><h2>SuperVillain Group</h2></a>
    <ul>
        <li>Homepage for a design consultancy and agency that has recently formed. </li>
        <li>The first example of constrast comes from the choice of a white color for the typeface against a background <br> that appears to be black at first, and when examined, is actually a black "tv static" style screen giving some <br> slight action to the page and adding another contrast to the solid and static font.</li>
        <li>Though not a very unique example of contrast, it's extreme "basicness" stood out to me.</li>
        <li>Additionally, since this agency is trying to set themselves apart from others, there is an over all contrast of <br>
         the simplicity and boldness of the website to the often detailed and colorful websites of other agencies. 
        </li>
    </ul>

        <li>The repeditive elements of this page take a moment to decifer, but when you review the entirity it seems clear.</li>
        <li>The use of emoji's, especially heart emoji's, is repeated through out and gives a fun theme to the page.</li>
        <li>Primary titles share a similar typeface and design, attracting the eye to each information section. </li>
    </ul>

    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/"><h2>Codecademy: Catalog</h2></a>
    <p>Focusing on the Catalog page for Codecademy, we see a great example of alignment to organize information and options. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>To the left alignment</b></dt>
        <dd>we have a menu of Languages and Subjects.</dd>
        <dt><b>To the right slignment</b></dt>
        <dd>is a box and elements for courses and subjects, all aligned on a grid.</dd>
        <dt><b>Columns and grid</b></dt>
        <dd>The entire page seems to be structured in four columns, and either a four or eight columned grid. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The elements are well structures and present an easy to follow hierarchy. </p>
